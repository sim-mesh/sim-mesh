//! The conductor of a virtual-time run, for ether.py's `CoreEther`.
//!
//! In a virtual-time run most of what the ether does is the barrier: a
//! station says `idle`, T moves to the next instant anything needs, and the
//! stations due there are sent a `run`. That is a few microseconds of work
//! done a few hundred thousand times a run, and in Python it was most of the
//! ether's time. Here it is done in Rust, on the ether's socket, in the event
//! loop's thread: the stations' conductor records (`seq`, `idle`, `until`,
//! `told`, the resend buffer), T, and the barrier's counts live here.
//!
//! Everything else stays in Python and is called at the same points as
//! before, synchronously, so a run takes the same steps in the same order:
//! the medium (`state` and `tx`, held for the barrier and handed over in
//! station order), the events on the ether's clock, what the stations printed,
//! a station's first words (`hello`), its channels (`wrote`, `read`), its host
//! door (`floor`), and pacing. This is the only conductor: the one in
//! ether.py's `Ether` is retired.
