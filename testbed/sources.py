**Finding a rectangle's files**, by the method a source names:

- `template`: the size_deg tiles of degrees, or the size_m tiles of a
  projected system (BEV's 50 km squares of LAEA Europe), meeting the
  rectangle's grid, each named by its south-west corner (or its north-west
  one, as USGS names 3DEP's), its address the url with {tile}; read as a
  window, the part of each the grid needs.
- `atom`: the tiles a feed lists whose square, its corner read off the file
  name in the feed's units, meets the rectangle's grid in the feed's zone.
- `regions`: the smallest region of the index whose outline holds the whole
  rectangle, its `file`.
- `file`: the one file.

A file is cached under its address's own name: a template's or a feed's
tile as its URL names it, a region's as `<region>` and the URL's suffix
(`berlin.osm.pbf`), a single file as the URL names it when that is a plain
file name and else as `<id>` and its suffix (`itu.zip`).

Every build shares the cache, so a second region beside the first fetches
only what is new. A file is fetched once: into `<file>.part`, resumed from
where it stopped by a range request, and renamed into place when whole. A
file its host does not have (GLO-30 has no tile over open sea) leaves a
`<file>.absent` beside it and is not asked for again, unless its source says
a missing file is an error (`missing: error`). An address with mirrors is
tried in order, and the next one when one fails.

**A build takes every source whose coverage meets its rectangle**: Berlin's
own data where the rectangle touches Berlin, GLO-30 and OpenStreetMap's
buildings on the rest, the Zensus grid where it touches Germany. `plan` says
which, and what each is used for by its priority in each layer; the compiler
is never given a priority, and measured data overwrites the worldwide data
on the cells it covers (INTERNALS, "Priority is the plan's").

Every request names sim-mesh in its User-Agent, a 429 or 5xx is retried after
the Retry-After the host gives (or a growing pause), and nothing is fetched
that a build does not need.
