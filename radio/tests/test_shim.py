"""The time shim, in a stand-in station, against a fake conductor.

standin.c links the chip library and runs a thread that sleeps in 25 ms steps,
one in 40 ms timed condition waits, and an interval timer at 10 ms; it is started with the shim preloaded, in a
virtual-time run with the thread census on. The conductor here grants T only
up to what the station last asked for, as the ether does, and every event the
station prints must land at its own instant in node time. retuner.c switches
channel as reticulum's SX1262 driver does, waiting BUSY out in 10 µs sleeps.
