/**
 * model — the SX1262 behind the C ABI.
 *
 * The driver above it is the one that runs on hardware, unchanged: it writes
 * the same opcodes, reads the same registers, polls or waits on the same DIO1
 * line and reads the same IRQ bits. What this supplies is the other end of the
 * bus — a command interpreter, a register file, a payload buffer, and the
 * timing of a frame, which is where a radio actually lives.
 *
 * A frame in flight is three instants: the end of its preamble, the end of its
 * header, and the end of the frame. The model schedules the receiver's
 * interrupts on those instants with one-shot timers, so a driver that disables
 * its interrupt, drains, and re-enables sees exactly the edges it sees on a
 * board.
 *
 * Commands take effect at once (BUSY is never busy), with one exception the
 * part imposes itself: with DIO3 driving a TCXO (SetDIO3AsTCXOCtrl), leaving
 * STDBY_RC or SLEEP for a mode that runs on the reference waits out the
 * start-up the driver programmed. A frame goes on the air, and a receiver or a
 * CAD starts, only then; meanwhile the medium sees the chip as FS. STDBY_XOSC,
 * FS and a fallback to either keep the reference running, as on the part.
 *
 * What is between two radios is the ether (ether_link.cpp): the model hands it
 * every transmission and every change of mode or carrier, and is handed back
 * the frames that reach its antenna.
